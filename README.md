# Tensorflow in Practice Specialization
<p> This repository contains my full documentation of Coursera's Tensorflow in Practice Specialization taught by the instructor Laurence Moroney offered by deeplearning.ai. </p>

<h2> About the Specialization </h2>
<p> 
In this specialization, you’ll explore exciting opportunities for AI applications. Begin by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improve a network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. You’ll teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network. You’ll even train an AI to create original poetry!
